    "section": "",
    "text": "The Power Five is no more this upcoming college football season, with the Pac-12 Conference dissolving with all of it’s teams leaving to different conferences. So lets look back on the last five full seasons, which excludes the 2020 season, to see where all five of these conferences ranked throughout those years and who is number one.\nWhen fans talk about the best Power Five conference, they always debate who is the best conference. Is it the SEC? Big Ten? or maybe there is an argument for the other three as well.\nMetrics like Simple Rating System (SRS) were used. SRS is a metric that measures the average point differential and strength of schedule. Who has been on top over the last five full seasons SRS wise?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nsrs &lt;- read_csv(\"PowerfiveSRS - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nSEC &lt;- srs |&gt; \n  filter(Conf == \"SEC\")\n\nBIG &lt;- srs |&gt; \n  filter(Conf == \"Big Ten\")\n\nBigtwelve &lt;- srs |&gt; \n  filter(Conf == \"Big 12\")\n\nPAC &lt;- srs |&gt; \n  filter(Conf == \"Pac-12\")\n\nACC &lt;- srs |&gt; \n  filter(Conf == \"ACC\")\n\n ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=SEC, aes(x=Year, y=SRS, group=Conf), color=\"gold\") + geom_line(data=BIG, aes(x=Year, y=SRS, group=Conf), color=\"cyan\") + geom_line(data=Bigtwelve, aes(x=Year, y=SRS, group=Conf), color=\"red\") + geom_line(data=PAC, aes(x=Year, y=SRS, group=Conf), color=\"darkblue\") + geom_line(data=ACC, aes(x=Year, y=SRS, group=Conf), color=\"darkgrey\")+ \n  geom_text(aes(x=2018, y=6.82, label=\"Big 12\"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2018, y=10.9, label=\"SEC\"), color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2018, y=6, label=\"Big Ten\"), color=\"cyan\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2018, y=4.79, label=\"ACC\"), color=\"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2018, y=3.33, label=\"Pac-12\"), color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.1, y=5.72, label=\"5.92\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.1, y=7.98, label=\"7.68\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.1, y=6.43, label=\"6.43\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.1, y=4.25, label=\"4.35\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.1, y=7, label=\"6.86\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Simple Rating System\", \n    title=\"The SEC Leads In Simple Rating System\", \n    subtitle=\"The SEC has controlled the top spot for most of the last five years.

So does that mean that they are the top conference? Not quite. There are other metrics to use to measure this as well.\nSRS measures regular season statistics, but that is not the only part of the college football season. Bowl games and the college football playoff exist. How do we measure who has been the best in terms of postseason games in college football? We can look at bowl game wins and winning percentage. Winning percentage is key to look at since conferences can have different amount of teams in them. Who has performed the best in late December and early January?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nbowls &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBPostseason - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nConferences &lt;- c(\"Big Ten\", \"SEC\", \"Pac-12\", \"Big 12\", \"ACC\")\n\nbowls |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Wins)) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    TotalGames = \"Total Games\",\n    WinPercentage = \"Win %\",\n    CFBPlayoffAppearences = \"CFB Playoff Appearences\",\n    Wins = \"W\",\n    Losses = \"L\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Who Is The Best Conference In Postseason Games\",\n    subtitle = \"The SEC once again is on top, including three championships.

Not by much, but the SEC has the most bowl wins, best winning percentage, and three championships in the past five full seasons. The biggest difference was the winning percentage between the SEC and Big Ten vs the other three.\nWe’ve pretty much established who is at the top of the mountain for the Power Five, but does the name “Power Five” really resonate. Are all five of these conferences the top five in the country? We can measure that by combining wins and losses over the last five full seasons and see the total winning percentage.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nwl &lt;- read_csv(\"Conftotalwinpercentage - Sheet1.csv\")\nBIG &lt;- wl |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"Big Ten\"\n  )  \n  SEC &lt;- wl |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"SEC\"\n  )  \n  ACC &lt;- wl |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"ACC\"\n  )  \n  PAC &lt;- wl |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"Pac-12\"\n  ) \n  BTwelve &lt;- wl |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"Big 12\"\n  ) \nwl |&gt; \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=wl, aes(x=reorder(Conference, WinPercentage), weight=WinPercentage)) +\n  geom_bar(data=BIG, aes(x=reorder(Conference, WinPercentage), weight=WinPercentage), fill=\"black\") +\n   geom_bar(data=SEC, aes(x=reorder(Conference, WinPercentage), weight=WinPercentage), fill=\"darkblue\") +\n   geom_bar(data=ACC, aes(x=reorder(Conference, WinPercentage), weight=WinPercentage), fill=\"black\") +\n   geom_bar(data=PAC, aes(x=reorder(Conference, WinPercentage), weight=WinPercentage), fill=\"black\") +\n   geom_bar(data=BTwelve, aes(x=reorder(Conference, WinPercentage), weight=WinPercentage), fill=\"black\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Conference\", \n    y=\"Win Percentage Over The Last Five Full Seasons\", \n    title=\"The Power Five Stands Tall In Winning %\", \n    subtitle=\"The SEC by these statistics have won the best percentage of their games over the\\nlast five full seasons.

They are called the Power Five for a reason. However, conferences like the Sun Belt, American, and Mountain West aren’t as far behind for that fifth spot as a lot of people would think.\nWe definitely established that the SEC by all these metrics, is the No. 1 Conference in the Power Five. The Big Ten and Big 12 were neck and neck for second, while the ACC and Pac-12 are the two weakest conferences of the Power Five."
