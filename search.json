    "text": "2022 was quite the season for the Minnesota Vikings. Expectations were not too high, with first year head coach Kevin O’Connell coming in to take over for Mike Zimmer. But as the season went on, the team kept winning. Not in convincing fashion however.\nThey kept making games close, and were known to come back late in games to sneak out a win. The team did that 11 times that year, making fourth quarter comebacks to win. They eventually ended the season with a 13-4 record, and winning the NFC North division title.\nWith all the comebacks, was this team actually good, or was it luck? There are several things to look at to see this. Margin of Victory (MoV) is something important to look at. How much your team wins by on average throughout the season. How good was the Vikings MoV? It had to be good with 13 wins right? Not really…..\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nStandings &lt;- read_csv(\"2022NFLStandings - Sheet1.csv\")\n  \nMargin &lt;- Standings |&gt; \n  select(Tm, MoV) \n\nSKOL &lt;- Margin |&gt; \n  filter(Tm == \"Minnesota Vikings\")\n\nBuffalo &lt;- Margin |&gt; \n  filter(Tm == \"Buffalo Bills\")\n\nNiners &lt;- Margin |&gt; \n  filter(Tm == \"San Francisco 49ers\")\n  \nMargin |&gt;   \nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=Margin, aes(x=reorder(Tm,MoV), weight=MoV)) +\n   geom_bar(data=SKOL, aes(x=reorder(Tm,MoV), weight=MoV), fill=\"#4F2683\") +\n   geom_bar(data=Buffalo, aes(x=reorder(Tm,MoV), weight=MoV), fill=\"#00338D\") + \n   geom_bar(data=Niners, aes(x=reorder(Tm,MoV), weight=MoV), fill=\"#B3995D\") +\ncoord_flip() +\nlabs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Margin Of Victory\", \n    title=\"13 Wins Yet A Negative Margin Of Victory\", \n    subtitle=\"The Bills and 49ers were the only other 13 win teams in 2022.

For that statistic, it really does say how lucky they did get. 13-4 record and your average MoV is in the negative…not ideal.\nIs this a coincidence? There was two other teams who won 13 games in 2022, and they were both at the top of the league for MoV. So the Vikings must have been bad on one side of the ball then. Simple Rating System (SRS) helps show the overall success of a team’s offense and defense.

The 2022 team had the worst SRS of any team in the last 10 years. The defense is holding the offense back. Who knows where this team could have gone if they had even an average defense.\nBut what about the fourth quarter comebacks? How did those affect the amount of wins the team had. For sure a good amount. But what if there was no fourth quarter? How good would the team’s point differential be then?

What does this all mean? It means that this team did need to rely on some luck to win football games. If there was no fourth quarter this team would have been at the bottom of the NFC, preparing for the NFL Draft. Instead they made the playoffs, getting a home playoff game for the first time since 2017 when they had the Minneapolis Miracle against the Saints.\nWhat it all boils down to is yes, this team did get very lucky and fortunate with all the comebacks late in games. They however showed their true colors in the NFC Wild Card game, when they lost to Daniel Jones and the New York Giants. You can’t rely on luck all the time to win football games."

    "text": "The Power Five is no more this upcoming college football season, with the Pac-12 Conference dissolving with all of it’s teams leaving to different conferences. So lets look back on the last five full seasons, which excludes the 2020 season, to see where all five of these conferences ranked throughout those years and who is number one.\nWhen fans talk about the best Power Five conference, they always debate who is the best conference. Is it the SEC? Big Ten? or maybe there is an argument for the other three as well.\nMetrics like Simple Rating System (SRS) were used. SRS is a metric that measures the average point differential and strength of schedule. Who has been on top over the last five full seasons SRS wise?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nsrs &lt;- read_csv(\"PowerfiveSRS - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nSEC &lt;- srs |&gt; \n  filter(Conf == \"SEC\")\n\nBIG &lt;- srs |&gt; \n  filter(Conf == \"Big Ten\")\n\nBigtwelve &lt;- srs |&gt; \n  filter(Conf == \"Big 12\")\n\nPAC &lt;- srs |&gt; \n  filter(Conf == \"Pac-12\")\n\nACC &lt;- srs |&gt; \n  filter(Conf == \"ACC\")\n\n ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=SEC, aes(x=Year, y=SRS, group=Conf), color=\"gold\") + geom_line(data=BIG, aes(x=Year, y=SRS, group=Conf), color=\"cyan\") + geom_line(data=Bigtwelve, aes(x=Year, y=SRS, group=Conf), color=\"red\") + geom_line(data=PAC, aes(x=Year, y=SRS, group=Conf), color=\"darkblue\") + geom_line(data=ACC, aes(x=Year, y=SRS, group=Conf), color=\"darkgrey\")+ \n  geom_text(aes(x=2018, y=6.82, label=\"Big 12\"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2018, y=10.9, label=\"SEC\"), color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2018, y=6, label=\"Big Ten\"), color=\"cyan\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2018, y=4.79, label=\"ACC\"), color=\"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2018, y=3.33, label=\"Pac-12\"), color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.1, y=5.72, label=\"5.92\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.1, y=7.98, label=\"7.68\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.1, y=6.43, label=\"6.43\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.1, y=4.25, label=\"4.35\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2023.1, y=7, label=\"6.86\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Simple Rating System\", \n    title=\"The SEC Leads In Simple Rating System\", \n    subtitle=\"The SEC has controlled the top spot for most of the last five years.

There are other metrics to use to measure this as well.\nSRS measures regular season statistics, but that is not the only part of the college football season. Bowl games and the college football playoff exist. How do we measure who has been the best in terms of postseason games in college football? We can look at bowl game wins and winning percentage.

The Big Ten and Big 12 were neck and neck for second, while the ACC and Pac-12 are the two weakest conferences of the Power Five."
